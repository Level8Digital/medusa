          <p class="lead">
            In the opening two parts of our Trading Insights Series we evaluated the importance of probability and random distribution, and then covered some key misconceptions relating to technical analysis and price movement. We recommend you start at part one and work your way up, but this entry can stand alone.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-20">Intro</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Your mind is the most powerful piece of the puzzle when it comes to your trading success. Without developing the mentality of a pro trader, you will never achieve the results you desire. When it comes to mastering your mind, we can think of no one better to draw influence from than Buddha. In this entry to the series, we intend to turn back the clock to see if we can glean some valuable insight and apply it to our trading endeavors.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-20">Trading Pitfalls</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            There are several pitfalls most aspiring traders fall prey to when operating in the market. In our analysis, there are two categories of trading errors. We define these as conceptual errors and execution errors. While it’s tempting to focus on execution errors, we’ve found that addressing conceptual errors simultaneously fixes execution errors.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Conceptual errors stem from inappropriate ideas about trading. These errors are:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Not believing you need a defined strategy
            </li>
            <li>
              Blaming the market for your failures rather than taking responsibility
            </li>
            <li>
              Trying to get rich quick by trading in an aggressive and reckless fashion
            </li>
            <li>
              Not viewing your trading exploits over a set of trades and over-emphasizing individual trades
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4 class="mt-20">Error #1: Not believing you need a defined strategy</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            This is one of the most common and difficult to break trading habits. The market is a limitless environment where you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. Many traders enjoy this type of freedom and struggle to develop or follow trading rules. Some traders give lip service to the idea they need a defined game plan, but when it comes down to it they don’t embody or act out the belief that rules are necessary.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            By not having a gameplan, or not following your game plan, you will never allow yourself to find out what methods work best for you. When you factor in random variables based on your momentary perception you prevent yourself from learning what variables give you a real edge on the market over a set of trades. Many traders develop a plan, but when the moment comes they fail to execute their plan. This cycle tends to repeat itself over and over.
          </p>

            <p>An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea.</p>
            <footer class="mt-5">Buddha</footer>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="lead">
            It’s time to embrace action, not ideas. Create a plan and follow it for 20 to 30 trades. If the results are not what you hoped for, come up with a new plan, and try again. When you find something that works, stick with it until it doesn’t. In this way, you will learn, with a degree of certainty, what method produces the desired results.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-20">Error #2: Blaming the market for your failures</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Many traders fall into the habit of believing the market is responsible for their success or failure. The market is a dynamic sequence of events that has no feelings or emotions. It goes up, and it goes down. The market does not exist to make you a winner, just as it does not exist to make you a loser. If you depend on the market to make you a winner, the market can take your success away. If you trade like a gambler and the market gives you a series of winning trades, the market will eventually take the money back.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Once you realize it’s up to you to get what you want from the market, you will embrace the appropriate amount of responsibility.
          </p>

            <div class="quote-sign"></div>
            <p>It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p class="lead">
            When you take a huge loss, it’s not the market's fault — it’s yours. The contradictory component here is that if you find yourself in a huge winning trade it’s not necessarily because you’re a great trader. Anyone with any degree of skill can stumble into a big winning trade, even a complete amateur. Therefore, big losses beyond what you define as acceptable are your fault, but big winners beyond what you can imagine are not a product of your ability. Why? Because you could have prevented the loss with your actions, but the winner just happened to occur at the right moment.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Professionals don’t allow themselves to believe they are responsible for big winners — they understand it was just an occurrence of the behavior pattern that gives them an edge on the market and the next trade could very well be a controlled loss.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            If you believe that a single huge winning trade is more important than a consistent mindset you are missing the big picture. When you master the appropriate mental techniques the market cannot take your success away. You will keep the gains you make and you’ll have the ability to keep winning in a consistent fashion. It’s time to take responsibility and conquer your mind.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-20">Error #3: Trying to get rich quick by trading in an aggressive and reckless fashion</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Many people get into trading because it seems like the easiest way to make money. In addition, they think it’s their ticket to quick riches, almost like winning the lottery. Indeed, a select few individuals have been extremely lucky and have gotten rich on pure gambles in the market. Yet, if these people kept trading in the same reckless fashion they were not rich for long. There are many high-risk ways to trade the market and inexperienced people are drawn to these methods by the lure of some fast life-changing cash.
          </p>

            <p>Patience is key. Remember: A jug fills drop by drop.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p class="lead">
            There are 252 trading days in a year. If a day trader can consistently earn just 0.5% on their account per day, they can gain 125% in a year. Alternatively, if a swing trader can earn 1-2% per week, they can gain 50 to 100% on their capital in the same period. Any money manager would be ecstatic to produce such results.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            If you cannot consistently earn 0.5% per day or 2% per week, what makes you think you can earn 100% in a month, and keep it? If getting rich trading the market was easy every retail trader who attempts to trade would be rich.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-20">Error #4: Not viewing your trading exploits over a set of trades</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Nearly every trader has the tendency to view each trade in a vacuum. In other words, each trade either proves or disproves the trader’s methodology or ability, and determines their emotional state. Any trade that does not meet the trader’s expectations causes frustration and mental distress. The problem is, that no trading system tells you what will happen on any given trade. A trading strategy only gives you an approximation of what you can expect over many trades. There is no other way a strategy can work. You must view each trade as a part of a set — this is what it truly means to think in probabilities.

          </blockquote>

          <p class="lead">
            When you have a methodology that gives you a positive expectancy, you must learn that you will never know in advance which trade will work. Each trade has its own unique outcome but also exists as a part of many trades. When you have a system that tips the odds in your favor, you must view the big picture and not let losing trades affect your positive mindset.
